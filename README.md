# Grim
- terminal pixel based RPG
- turn based combat
  - Mario Luigi superstar saga combat...? So it feels more souls-like
- dog companion
- weapons, armor, enhancements,...
- fiends, beasts, curses, extremas, hybrids,...
- grim dark bloodbourne medieval type world
- open-wordly
  - maybe some areas will be locked
  - maybe a guide like elden ring (haven't played through a whole dark souls game, so I don't know how it's executed fully)
- achievement system

## Roadmap
- [ ] learn how to use `ncurses` library
