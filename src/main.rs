    // 5. prompt him to play a creature for 1 mana
    // 6. tell him about not being able to tap creatures and therefore not being able to attack on the first turn
    // 7. prompt him to end the turn
    //
    // [ computer ]
    // 7. simulate its turn by drawing a card, placing a mana card, tapping said mana, placing a creature
    //    and ending the turn
    //
    // [ player]
    // 8. prompt him to draw a card, explain to him that you draw a card every turn, if you run out
    //    of cards, you lose health
    // 9. prompt him to play another mana card and another creature
    // 10. prompt him to enter attacking phase, since one of his creatures is ready
    // 11. tell him about attacking - you attack the foe directly for dmg equal to your card's
    //     stats, the game ends when one of you loses all health
    // 12. tell him about blocking - the enemy can choose to block your creature with his creature, IF it
    //     can be tapped, preventing said dmg to him, but transfering it to its creature instead
    // 13. tell him about creature "standoff" - when does one creature die from blocking/attacking
    //     by comparing stats of both cards (don't mention instant spells yet)
    // 14. simulate the standoff, player's creature will win and live, the enemy one will die and
    //     go to graveyard
    // 15. tell him about the graveyard, simple
    // 16. prompt him to end the turn
    //
    // [ computer ]
    // 17. simulate its turn by drawing a card and ending the turn by not doing anything
    //
    // [ player ]
